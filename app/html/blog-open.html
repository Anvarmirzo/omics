						<p>Motivation The composition and density of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment profoundly influence
							tumor
							progression and success of anti-cancer therapies. Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry staining, or
							single-cell
							sequencing is often unavailable such that we rely on computational methods to estimate the immune-cell
							composition
							from bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Various methods have been proposed recently, yet their
							capabilities
							and
							limitations have not been evaluated systematically. A general guideline leading the research community
							through cell
							type deconvolution is missing.
						</p>
						<p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration
							in some form,
							by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use
							a passage of
							Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the
							Lorem Ipsum
							generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true
							generator on the
							Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence
							structures, to
							generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from
							repetition,
							injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
						<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
							Latin literature
							from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College
							in Virginia,
							looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through
							the cites of
							the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
							1.10.32 and 1.10.33
							of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book
							is a treatise
							on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum
							dolor sit
							amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
