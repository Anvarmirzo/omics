					<p>Motivation The composition and density of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment profoundly influence
						tumor
						progression and success of anti-cancer therapies. Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry staining, or
						single-cell
						sequencing is often unavailable such that we rely on computational methods to estimate the immune-cell
						composition from
						bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Various methods have been proposed recently, yet their capabilities and
						limitations
						have not been evaluated systematically. A general guideline leading the research community through cell type
						deconvolution is missing.
					</p>
					<p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration
						in
						some form,
						by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a
						passage of
						Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the
						Lorem
						Ipsum
						generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true
						generator
						on the
						Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence
						structures,
						to
						generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from
						repetition,
						injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
