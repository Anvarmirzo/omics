					bioinformatics
					practices and developing bioinformatics solutions, majority of the projects being in the field of
					immune-oncology. And
					we have realized that many of our clients have had the same struggle when analyzing biomarker data from their
					patients,
					and trying to draw conclusions from a huge amount of data generated from the patient’s samples.

				<p class="vision__subtitle">Recent revolution in molecular screening technologies led to an explosion in the
					amount of data generated from a
					patient. During a clinical trial in oncology one patient can generate over 100 GB of raw unprocessed data.
					However,
					analysis of that data is a challenge and a bottleneck, due to the complex nature of the data, absence of
					existing
					standards and lack of skilled people who can process this data.

						<p>At <span class="text-medium">OmicsChart</span> we are set to make clinical trial data from a chaotic
							collection of files into information
							that can be

							develop better
							strategies, de-risk the clinical trial, and ultimately, save lives.</p>
